# python-api-challenge
In this challenge we had to do a list of different cities by creating a random list of numbers that would range from -90 to 90 for the latitude list and a list that ranged from -180 to 180 for our longitude list. With this list we retrieved the with the citypy API what cities those latitude and longitudes belong to and started from there. Once we had retrieved our cities and made a list.

After that, we retrieved the weather information with the WEATHER api and made some statistical exercises to see if there was a relationship between the latitude and different variables.

Then we used that city dataframe that contained diverse info about each city like its humidty, max temperature and coordinates to retrieve from the geoapify the nearest hotel in each city. Then we used a hvplot to visualize the different hotels on the world map.
